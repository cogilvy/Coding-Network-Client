# The Coding Network Client

The Coding Network was designed to be a Facebook clone with limited functionality. A User is able to signup, create posts, like and comment on other users posts, and become friends or 'follow' another user.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Before you have cloned and started the frontend, you will first need to do the same with the backend repo to be able to fully use/test the project. [Backend Found Here](https://github.com/cogilvy/bookface-backend)

### Installing and Running the App

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.
Make sure to run the backend before trying to start the frontend.
To clone and start the backend:

```
$ git clone
$ cd [repo location]
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
